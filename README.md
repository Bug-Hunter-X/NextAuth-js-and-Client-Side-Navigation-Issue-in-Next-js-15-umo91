# NextAuth.js and Client-Side Navigation Issue in Next.js 15

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using NextAuth.js for authentication in a Next.js 15 application.  The issue involves unexpected behavior during client-side navigation between pages after a successful login.

## Bug Description

The `About` page, which utilizes `getServerSideProps` to check for user authentication via NextAuth, does not render correctly when accessed after navigating from the home page. The session data isn't correctly passed to the component, causing unexpected display issues, or potentially a complete failure to render.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`.  You'll see the login/logout status as expected.
5. Navigate to `/` and then back to `/about`.  The authentication status and/or the page content may display incorrectly.

## Solution

The solution involves restructuring the authentication check and handling the client-side navigation more effectively.  The updated `about.js` provided in the `aboutSolution.js` file demonstrates this resolution.
